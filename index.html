    <p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593438361" target="_blank">Dune</a></h2></p>
    <p>by</p>
    <p>Frank Herbert</p>
    <p><img style="width:15%;height:25%;" src="dune.jpg"/></p>
    <p><i>Dune</i> is an extension of the premise and consequences of pursuing a philosophy of "potential maximization." It follows Paul Atreides journey in reaching his potential. It explores the dangers of wielding prophecy, the tautological endpoints of mysticism, and the merit of playing within a hierarchy versus outsider strategies. The density of its lore provides sufficient depth to explore all these themes. There are no aliens in dune, but there are creatures whose degree of alienation or alteration makes them seem inhuman. Something I've not often heard discussed is Dune's free-market themes. The world of Dune is dominated by conglomerates, monopolies, and guild corporations that impoverish and oppress almost everyone. This system is prevent's competition and props itself upon the only crutch such systems can use: the crutch of the sword. I mean this literally, of course, projectile weapons are irrelevant in Dune (for reasons readers will understand), and sword combat is commonplace. The pervasive violence of Dune is no mistake or exuberance on Herbet's part. The application of force is the underpinning of this world and you as the reader would do well to watch and dissect its presentation as you read. Dune's reflections on fear, ruthless force, hierarchy, and power can help us understand our world today. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.</p>

    <p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/198480278X" target="_blank">Stranger in a Strange Land</a></h2></p>
    <p>by</p>
    <p>Robert Heinlein</p>
    <p><img style="width:15%;height:25%;" src="stranger_in_a_strange_land.jpg"/></p>
    <p>In The Bible, Exodus 2:22, Moses says "I have been a stranger in a strange land." which describes his sense of otherness in the land of Midian. This is a story about the unsettling realities that make us human. A man comes from mars to live on earth and rediscovers a strange homeland that will seem familiar and bizarre to many readers today (a world with a UN government, flying taxis). In <i>Stranger</i> force is not examined as a natural constraint of our reality, but rather a dimension to alter. Love (both emotional and physical) is dissected and separated from its consequences. The removal of suffering and its consequences, and speculation on how that would affect the trajectory of human cultural development dominate parts of the story. The book reflects the spirit of the 1960s in which ideas that an awakened consciousness unbounded might change the world. The consequences of altering these human realities, the unsettling truths that must be known to accomplish this are really what the story proposes to you as the reader to question. We are made to ask what becomes of a reality not based on truths we have known, but truths that could be, things altogether unknown to humans. A culture at once gentle, hungry, promiscuous, alien.</p>
    
    <p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0141188626" target="_blank">The Fountainhead</a></h2></p>
    <p>by</p>
    <p>Ayn Rand</p>
    <p><img style="width:15%;height:25%;" src="the_fountainhead.jpg"/></p>
    <p>Normally I think of romanticism as the art and beauty of what could be. Opposing them, Realist thinkers tend to be more preoccupied with the constraints, the beauty of the eternal that is. Rand, unusually, manages to blend Romanticism and Realism in a clash between different philosophical schools of architecture. The book is of course, not about the erection of structures, or the competition between rivals, and not even the construction of the man of Roark, but rather the discovery of one. Roark is an archetype, the journey of the reader mirrors that of the other characters in their voyage of discovery to find him. No examination of why Roark is the way he is given. In Rand's conception, he simply is: pure, moral, true, eternal, and justified. The story is a relation between objects. Though another great irony is that while much literature with a focus on a "pure male protagonist" revolves around their fixation to possess those objects, Roark never does. He seeks to possess nothing but the things he builds until he lets them go. As the reader, you are encouraged to probe the relationship between beauty and possession, possession and ownership. A critical reading of <i>The Fountainhead</i> should provoke questions and examination of one's own life and individuality (are you owner, or owned? why?). Rand is sometimes considered controversial for her views. Haram writers often communicate uncomfortable truths. Truths about justice, the self and the other, truths about the beauty in the objects around us, and the desire to possess them.</p>
      
    <p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679750150" target="_blank">The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea</a></h2></p>
    <p>by</p>
    <p>Yukio Mishima</p>
    <p><img style="width:15%;height:25%;" src="the_sailor.jpeg"/></p>
    <p><i>The Sailor</i> is about the sterility of modern society, its marginalization of romantic masculine attributes, for easier, safer, more demure expressions of life. Noboru and his gang of compatriots react to this with violence and antisocial behavior. Their horrific actions, the tension leading up to them, are all of course punctuated by an overcurrent of innocence, they aren't even teenagers yet -- they're merely responding to death with life in the only way they know. Mishima tries to communicate something about the deep violence within all of us and especially all men. Personally, I don't think it glorifies violence, its descriptions are too uncomfortable to be glorifications and yet maintain their air of romanticism. Noboru's reaction to a man competing for his mother's attention, and beauty recalls the basest of instincts, the recognition of beauty, and the desire to possess it (but perhaps never own). To Noboru, this man represents freedom from the slavery he and his thirteen-year-old gang of philosophers despise, of course, these romantic ideals are inevitably betrayed. This is perhaps a not-so-subtle critique of the unreasonableness of romanticism, the unreasonableness of the type of freedom these boys seek, and the disgusting ends reveal perhaps the endpoint for this way of thinking, death. Not only do they reject modern civilization and its limitations, they actively seek destructive outlets as a mockery of it, but they also are forced to mock themselves. That complex message should provoke you to question society and the violent antisocial behavior that manifests all too regularly.</p>

    <p><h2><a href="">About</a></h2></p>
    <p>I wanted to make a book club with some of the books I've been reading. I find that often when I look back on a set of books I notice themes or collections of similar ideas. Hopefully each book here should be easy to read and hard to put down. Though I am recommending specific books, my goal is not to tell you what to read. I want to help you think about books and help you enrich your mind.</p>
