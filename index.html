      <p id="description">The Fountainhead is about </p>
      <p>why should you read this book? well it's romantic, which means it's about how the world could be. most right wing philosophy is about how the world is, our natural constraints, our sins, our limitations and the noble goal to live within and progress against them. this book is entirely different because it deals with the realm of the possible and unlimited, not the probable and constrained.</p>
      <p>The book is nothing short of incredible. It has ideas inside of it that compel the reader to question what it means to be an individual. thinking, creative being in the world. The idea of balancing one's own projection of self into the world and the wants of others on the self is the major theme. Another is beauty and the ways in which broader human society mistreats beautiful things, and breaks them. One prescient scene is when dominique describes destroying a priceless statue so that nobody else can marr it's beauty with their unworthy appraisal. The concept of beauty and the self are very closely related and provide a foundation for further thought about one's own life.</p>
