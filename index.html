      <li><a href="">The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand</a></li>

      <p id="description">Normally I think of romanticism as the art and beauty of what could be. Realist thinkers tend to be more preoccupied with the constraints, the beauty of what is. Rand unusually manages to blend Romanticism and Realism in a clash between different philosophical schools of architecture. The book is of course, not about the erection of structures, and not even the construction of a man, but rather the discovery of one. Roark is an archetype of a hero, his journey is one of voyage and discovery. Is this object something I like, or am I told to like it? What is the relationship between beatuy and possesion, posession and ownership? What obligations do I have to the social fabric around me, where should those obligations begin an end? Lots of people don't like her, but that's precisely why you should read her. A critical reading of it should provoke questions and examination of one's own life and individuality. Books and writers denounced often contain uncomfortable truths. Truths about justice, truths about the self and the other, truths about the beauty in the objects around us, and truths in the desire to possess them.</p>

      <li><a href="">Dune by Frank Herbert</a></li>

      <p>Dune is an extension of the premise and consequences of pursuing a philosophy of "potential maximization." It follow's Paul Atreides journey in reaching his potential. It explores the dangers of wielding prophecy, the tautological endpoints of mysticism, and the merit of playing within a hierarchy versus outsider strategies. The density of its lore provides sufficient depth to explore all these themes. There are no aliens in dune, but there are creatures whose degree of alteration makes them inhuman. Something I've not often heard dicussed is Dune's free market themes. The world of dune is dominated by conglomerates, monopolies, and guild corporations that impoverish and oppress almost everyone. This system is supported the only way such systems can be: by the sword. I mean this literally of course, projectile weapons are irrelevant in Dune (for reasons you will understand if you read), and sword combat is commonplace. The pervasive violence of Dune is no mistake or exuberance on Herbet's part. The application of force is the underpinning of this world and you as the reader would do well to watch and dissect its presentation as you read. Dune's reflections on fear, ruthless force, hierarchy, and power are astounding and relevant today. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.</p>
      
      <li><a href="">Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein</a></li>
      
      <p id="description"> In The Bible, Exodus 2:22, Moses says "I have been a stranger in a strange land." which describes his feeling of otherness in the land of Midian. This is a story about the unsettled realities that make us human. A man comes from mars to live on earth and rediscovers a strange homeland that will seem familiar and strange to many readers today (a world with a UN government, flying taxis). In <i>Stranger</i> force is not examined as a natural constraint of our reality, but rather a dimension to alter. Love is dissected and separated from it's physical consequences. The removal of suffering and its consequences, and sepculation on how that would affect the trajectory of the human species. The story fundamentally reflects the spirit of an age (the 60s) in which ideas that an awakened consciousness unbounded might actually change the world. The consequences of altering these human realities, the unsettling truths that must be known to accomplish this are really what the story proposes to you as the reader to question. We are made to ask what becomes of a reality not based on truths we have known, but truths that could, but something altogether unknown to humans, gentle, cannibalistic, promiscuous, alien.</p>

      
      <li><a href="">The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell</a></li>
      <p></p>
      
      <li><a href="">The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea by Yukio Mishima</a></li>
      <p><i>The Sailor</i> is about the sterility of modern society, it's marginalization of romantic masculine attributes and values, for easier, safer, more mild expressions. Noboru and his gang of compariots react to this with violence and antisocial behavior. Even the the parts of the story which don't  Not only do they reject modern civilization and it's limitations, they actively seek destructive outlets as a mockery of it. </p>
